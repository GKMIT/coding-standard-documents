iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a [mobile operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system) created and developed by [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) exclusively for [its hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices). It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone), and [iPod Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch); it also powered the [iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad) prior to the introduction of [iPadOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS) in 2019.

  

We have summarised some of the best practices for iOS development. Letâ€™s look at them -

# Naming Conventions:

-   Folder and File name is always in pascal case.
    
-   Component Name should follow the pascal case
    
-   The object and variable declaration should always be in camel case statement.
    

  

# Swift Syntax Practices

1.  Trailing Semicolon Violation: Lines should not have trailing semicolons. (trailing_semicolon)

2.  Opening Brace Spacing Violation: Opening braces should be preceded by a single space and on the same line as the declaration. (opening_brace) e.g. function {

3.  Colon Violation: Colons should be next to the identifier when specifying a type and next to the key in dictionary literals. (colon) e.g. identifier: Int

4.  Vertical Whitespace Violation: Limit vertical whitespace to a single empty line. Currently 2. (vertical_whitespace)

5.  Unused Closure Parameter Violation: Unused parameter "action" in a closure should be replaced with _. (unused_closure_parameter)

6.  Control Statement Violation: `if`, `for`, `guard`, `switch`, `while`, and `catch` statements shouldn't unnecessarily wrap their conditionals or arguments in parentheses. (control_statement)

7.  Redundant Void Return Violation: Returning Void in a function declaration is redundant. (redundant_void_return)

8.  Statement Position Violation: Else and catch should be on the same line, one space after the previous declaration. (statement_position)

9.  For Where Violation: `where` clauses are preferred over a single `if` inside a `for`. (for_where)

10. Identifier Name Violation: Variable name should be between 3 and 40 characters long: 'vc' (identifier_name)

11. Closure Parameter Position Violation: Closure parameters should be on the same line as opening brace. (closure_parameter_position)

12. Weak Delegate Violation: Delegates should be weak to avoid reference cycles. (weak_delegate)

13. Shorthand Operator Violation: Prefer shorthand operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) over doing the operation and assigning. (shorthand_operator)
